* The Add Bookmark menu item and toolbar button are only enabled when pages are bookmarkable.
* Choose bookmark bar colors based on mainWindow? rather then keyWindow?.
* Sort by 'fullName' now instead of 'name'.
* Improved the search query a bit for some abbreviation possibilities. But it seems the * wildcard doesn't get passed characters like :?_ etc.
* Added basic print support.
* The Make Text Normal Size menu item should be between the others.
* Made the search results tableview scrollbars hide automatically.
* Made history work again.
* Don't allow any non-bookmarkable pages in the history.
