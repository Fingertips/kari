- Add latest history items to History menu.

- Add bookmark functionality.

- The original filter bar code creates the gradient colors itself, but since CTGradient 1.6 there are presets for often used color combinations. So we need to take a look at which preset fits the bookmark bar best.

- The resizing and other window related crashes are now fixed by removing the undocumented API to remove the toolbar toggle button. For now I'll just leave it on, so please check if we do or don't want this button to be visible.

- Still need to add the "disabled" icon code for the history buttons. (Wait until we know what we will do with the icons.)

- The icons that are used for the custom views in the toolbar are copied from the Safari.app bundle.
  It might not be a problem because of the correct usage of said icons, however we should check with Apple.

- Window title should be the title of the page (class name), but this is not yet implemented in html coming from the backend.

- Don't store the history for all the search results, this should be fixed once the backend gets worked on.
