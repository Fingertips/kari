ELOY

- Resize search filter bar buttons so they aren't bigger than necessary.
- Status bar. For:
  - Show where links in the docs go.
  - Search results count, like the Finder Search window.
- Rewrite to MacRuby.
- Consistenly use snake/camel case for all the ib_outlets.

MANFRED

- Lock the karidoc directory somehow when indexing so we don't accidentally revert index updates
- Think about a way to solve the uppercased instance method problem in the RubyName optimization

ANYONE

- Return to the last selected path in the class browser when a new class tree is assigned if possible. Work your way back up the tree and select the first item that is in the tree.
- Filter the nodes in the class browser. Eg: http://tr.im/2ary

IMPROVEMENTS

- Move splitView related code from ApplicationController into a subclass of NSSplitView and be sure to override resetCursorRect to _not_ use a different cursor when the divider is hidden.
- Find and show Ruby installations in the source list of the 'Browse Ruby Installation' dialog
- Use a code highlighter to highlight examples
- Flag karidoc files with 'broken characters' (to prevent bugreports and gently nudge authors to fix their documentation)
- Make clicking the gem name/version, in the header, open the gem directory in the Finder.
- Check possibilities to wrap SKSearchRef via BridgeSupport (with Laurent).
