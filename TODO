# ELOY

- Window title should be the title of the page (class name), but this is not yet implemented in html coming from the backend. - Ok, make it "Kari â€“ #{title}", I'll make sure the <title></title> contains the appropriate title. (manfred)
- Application name should be set, it's NewApplication now in the menu's.
- Remove all the copyright notices from the source files. Unless you want them there?
- Remove the bookmark bar for now, we've decided that we have too little time to make it work perfectly.

- Still need to add the "disabled" icon code for the history buttons. (Wait until we know what we will do with the icons.)
- The icons that are used for the custom views in the toolbar are copied from the Safari.app bundle. It might not be a problem because of the correct usage of said icons, however we should check with Apple.
- Integrate Sparkle.framework for updates
- Quit the application when the main window is closed.
- Don't store the history for all the search results. (see requirements on what to store in the history)
- Add latest history items to History menu.

- Add bookmark functionality.
- The resizing and other window related crashes are now fixed by removing the undocumented API to remove the toolbar toggle button. For now I'll just leave it on, so please check if we do or don't want this button to be visible. If we decide to keep the toggle button, then extra redraw code should be added to setup the tracking rects for the new window state after a toggle. - Keep the toggle button please (manfred)

- Remove unused files, if any.
- Check 10.3.x compatibility

# MANFRED

- Index should also remove missing RI documentation on update.
- Write JS to allow result selection with the arrow keys and enter to select a link.
- Add proper documentation to the kari/**/* files.
- Strip the libraries in lib/ to only contain stuff we actually need.
- Show all the comments for a class or method when a 'get' returns more than one object.
- Benchmark and improve performance more.
- Read the plist so we can share configuration between the frontend and backend.
