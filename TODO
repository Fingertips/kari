ELOY

- Rewrite to MacRuby.
- Consistenly use snake/camel case for all the ib_outlets.

MANFRED

- Find a way to reload the indices without crashing
  - Generate in the background
  - Close manager
  - Move to the Application Support directory
  - Open manager
- Lock the karidoc directory somehow when indexing so we don't accidentally revert index updates
- Think about a way to solve the uppercased instance method problem in the RubyName optimization

ANYONE

- Karidoc test gem:
  - Add doc and external (http|https) links to test the status bar.
- Return to the last selected path in the class browser when a new class tree is assigned if possible. Work your way back up the tree and select the first item that is in the tree.
- Filter the nodes in the class browser. Eg: http://tr.im/2ary

IMPROVEMENTS

- Resize search filter bar buttons so they aren't bigger than necessary. Don't use NSMatrix if we want this. (For instance MGScopeBar)
- Move splitView related code from ApplicationController into a subclass of NSSplitView.
- Find and show Ruby installations in the source list of the 'Browse Ruby Installation' dialog
- Use a code highlighter to highlight examples
- Flag karidoc files with 'broken characters' (to prevent bugreports and gently nudge authors to fix their documentation)
- Make clicking the gem name/version, in the header, open the gem directory in the Finder.
- Check possibilities to wrap SKSearchRef via BridgeSupport (with Laurent).
- Autolink URLs in the documentation.
- Make parts of the RubyName in the header of the documentation clickable.
