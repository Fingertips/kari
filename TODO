- Add latest history items to History menu.

- Add bookmark functionality.

- The original filter bar code creates the gradient colors itself, but since CTGradient 1.6 there are presets for often used color combinations. So we need to take a look at which preset fits the bookmark bar best.

- With the filter bar added to the project Kari wil crash after resizing the window. This does not happen when using the filter bar in a app without a webview and I have seen this behaviour when using a webview. The webview probably tries to resolve outlets at runtime, which does not work well with every object. So need to look into this.

- Still need to add the "disabled" icon code for the history buttons. (Wait until we know what we will do with the icons.)

- The icons that are used for the custom views in the toolbar are copied from the Safari.app bundle.
  It might not be a problem because of the correct usage of said icons, however we should check with Apple.

- Window title should be the title of the page (class name), but this is not yet implemented in html coming from the backend.

- Don't store the history for all the search results, this should be fixed once the backend gets worked on.
