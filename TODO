# ELOY

- Remove the bookmark bar for now, we've decided that we have too little time to make it work perfectly.
- Still need to add the "disabled" icon code for the history buttons. (Wait until we know what we will do with the icons.)
- The icons that are used for the custom views in the toolbar are copied from the Safari.app bundle. It might not be a problem because of the correct usage of said icons, however we should check with Apple.
- Add a contextual menu to remove bookmarks
- Remove unused files, if any.
- Check 10.3.x compatibility

# MANFRED

- Index should also remove missing RI documentation on update.
- Write JS to allow result selection with the arrow keys and enter to select a link.
- Add proper documentation to the kari/**/* files.
- Strip the libraries in lib/ to only contain stuff we actually need.
- Show all the comments for a class or method when a 'get' returns more than one object.
- Benchmark and improve performance more.
- Read the plist so we can share configuration between the frontend and backend.
  There are 2 options, either use the command line utility 'defaults' or use the Cocoa API like:
  require 'osx/foundation'
  prefs = OSX::NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults
  prefs.addSuiteNamed "com.fngtps.kari"
  path = prefs['RubyInstallation'].nil? ? '/usr' : prefs['RubyInstallation'].to_s
- Create Sparkle AppCast, edit Info.plist for the url.
