ANYONE

- Improve class browser UI, see http://tr.im/21ca

IMPROVEMENTS

- Find and show Ruby installations in the source list of the 'Browse Ruby Installation' dialog
- Use a code highlighter to highlight examples
- Flag karidoc files with 'broken characters' (to prevent bugreports and gently nudge authors to fix their documentation)
- Make clicking the gem name/version, in the header, open the gem directory in the Finder.
