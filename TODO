- Add latest history items to History menu.

- Add bookmark functionality.

- The resizing and other window related crashes are now fixed by removing the undocumented API to remove the toolbar toggle button. For now I'll just leave it on, so please check if we do or don't want this button to be visible. If we decide to keep the toggle button, then extra redraw code should be added to setup the tracking rects for the new window state after a toggle.

- Still need to add the "disabled" icon code for the history buttons. (Wait until we know what we will do with the icons.)

- The icons that are used for the custom views in the toolbar are copied from the Safari.app bundle.
  It might not be a problem because of the correct usage of said icons, however we should check with Apple.

- Window title should be the title of the page (class name), but this is not yet implemented in html coming from the backend.

- Don't store the history for all the search results, this should be fixed once the backend gets worked on.

- Quit the application when the main window is closed.

- Should be able to disable the bookmark bar.

- Integrate Sparkle.framework for updates

- Optionally check 10.3.x compatibility

Manfred:

- Add proper documentation to the kari/**/* files.
- Strip the libraries in lib/ to only contain stuff we actually need.
